# EECS301 Lab Report Expectations

This document outlines the expectations for what should be included in the EECS 301 lab reports.

## Lab Report Sections

Within each lab report, the following six sections are required, in the order listed below.  You are free to insert additional sections, if needed, to better illustrate your work. 

### Introduction

In this section, you will introduce the lab that you completed.  You should describe what the overall project is doing, and the architecture of the project. Additionally, you should mention the important skills/structures you learned about.

* The description of the project should use simple english, and not discuss the implementation of the modules, but rather describe what the system is doing, focusing on the interface, and the project’s handling of stimulus.

* The architectural description should focus on how this system is implemented.  You should use the block diagrams provided in the project guide to aid your understanding of the architecture.  This description should extend beyond what modules you implemented, and include details from other modules.  This description should enable a reader to understand how the project works.  _This may require you to read modules that you don’t have to write in order to understand what is happening. This is expected._

* The stills/structures you learned about should be introduced either in the architectural section (if its structural e.g shift registers) or in an additional paragraph that describes the skill(s).  Regardless of where it is introduced, it should be explicitly called out.  This section is used to ensure you understand what you should be learning.  

### Implementation Details

The **Implementation Details** section describes the modules that were completed for the assignment.  

* Each module should have a write-up detailing the functionality of the module.  Be sure to consider the Input and Output signals of each module, and how the two are related.  Additionally, you should describe how this functionality is implemented, by understanding the logic inside the module.  _This may require that you also read code inside modules that you did not write. This is expected._

* The Implementation Details should not include information about test benches, since they will be introduced in the [Verification Results](#verification-results) section.  

* The Implementation Details section **should not** be just a timeline or comment log of your progress, and should not distinguish work between partners for partner projects.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that you understand what you are doing in the lab, and that you read the provided guide. When a grader reads this section, they should be confident that you understand the project.

### Verification Results

The **Verification Results** section details how you tested your project, either though simulation or hardware probing.  

* This section should discuss tests you completed (e.g. pressing different buttons manually, handwritten test benches) as well as the provided test benches you were expected to use. 

* Provide ModelSim simulation waveform images, Oscilloscope screen captures, and/or photos as necessary to document the testing.  Additionally, include an explanation of what is happening in the images to illustrate that you understand what the images depict.

* Be sure to describe why these tests verify your results.  It is incorrect to say “Because a TA checked my lab and said it was good”.

* Please include a brief sentence with the name of the person who checked off your project.  

### Conclusions

The **Conclusions** section can be short summary of what was learned in the lab.    

* Briefly discuss aspects of the architecture, implementation, or verification testing that helped you learn something new or may be helpful in the future.

### Computer Usage Information & Time Spent 

This section does not have to be in complete sentences, but it should be structured. It must include the following information:

* Computer Operating System used (if using the Lab computers just say _Lab Computer_, we know the specs)

* Time Required to complete the lab, project, and write-up.  Ballpark estimates are OK but try to be as accurate as possible.  This feedback helps us balance the lab assignment workload to improve quality.

### Difficulties / Issues

This is an optional section to detail any problems you had with the lab.  If you did not encounter any problems then just skip the section.

* Issues Encountered

* Feedback _(optional)_
	
	Use this section to provide feedback about the lab.  Outline any skill you felt you needed to complete the lab that you lacked, or any portions that were too easy/hard.  You may also include skills you want to learn in the class, or feedback you have to improve lectures.  Please feel free to be honest, but respectful.  Any feedback helps us improve the course.


## Lab Report Time Allocation

The goal of the lab report is to document and show what you've learned in the lab but the focus of the labs is not on writing reports so we're not expecting thesis level work.  In industry, you'll often need to create detailed but succinct descriptions of what you're working on.  That's what we're looking for here.

The reports should take anywhere between 15 minutes up to an hour.  If you are committing more time than that to the report writeup then your level of detail may be too high and you should check with a TA to make sure you are not wasting time unnecessarily.

# Git Client Setup for macOS



## Git Client Options

There are a number Git client options available for Windows:

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* Xcode (command-line git utility)


## Xcode

:warning: If Xcode isn't installed, do **not** install it just for Git, it's huge. 

If you do have Xcode installed, you should already have the Git command-line application available from the terminal. 

The Xcode version of Git is (mostly) the same as the Linux version so see the Linux section for details.


## GitHub Desktop

**GitHub Desktop** is available for both Mac and Windows if cross-platform support is desired.  Both a GUI and command-line tools are provided.

Follow this guide for setting up GitHub Desktop:
